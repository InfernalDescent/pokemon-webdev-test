My free time attempt to design a functional website. 
The idea behind this, stated before starting the project so subject to change 
is to essentially create a website to follow-along with games in the Pokemon franchise. 
I have always wanted the route information availible in a map format, so you can choose a route in order of how you'd progress through the game and see information about that route, so you know what Pokemon/Items you could have by a certain point in the game.
